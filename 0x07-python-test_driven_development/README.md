# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

This directory contains a collection of files, functions, structs and scripts used to build and manage this repository. If there are any issues regarding the intention of a particular script (or even part of a certain script), please reach out to us.

We are using the [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) testing framework. This is a very popular testing framework, and it is very easy to use. It is also very flexible, and allows us to test a lot of different things.

All of the scripts in this directory are written in Python.

# 0x07.1.1. Test-driven development

TDD is a process of writing tests before writing code. This is a very common process, and it is very easy to do.
