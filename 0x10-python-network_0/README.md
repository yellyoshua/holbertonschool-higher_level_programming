# 0x10 - Python network 0

In this project, I learned about the following concepts:
- How to fetch internet resources with cURL
- How to decode `cURL` body response
- How to POST an email address to a URL with cURL

With the help of these concepts, I was able to create a Python script that takes in a URL and an email address, sends a POST request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and finally displays the body of the response.
